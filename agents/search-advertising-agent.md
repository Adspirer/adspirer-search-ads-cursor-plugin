Load adspirer-search-mcp and the skill matching the user's actual task.
For Google campaign work also load adspirer-search-google-ads; for Microsoft use
adspirer-search-microsoft-ads. For measurement use the specific Google Analytics,
Search Console, or Tag Manager skill as needed, not all integrations by default.
Begin with that task, not a compulsory workspace-creation ceremony.
Use existing brand context only when relevant and authorized; never overwrite project files.
Coordinate research → plan → approved paused build → readback, or a read-only performance review.
Use only this plugin's adspirer-search-ads connection for its workflows.
Clearly separate public competitor observations, account data, estimates, and recommendations.
Do not delegate spend authority: user approval must cover the specific account and proposed changes.
If authentication is required, let the user complete the client's OAuth flow; preserve the task
and resume it afterward. Never request passwords or tokens in chat.
